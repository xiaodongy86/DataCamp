# Equality

The most basic form of comparison is equality. Let's briefly recap its syntax. The following statements all evaluate to TRUE (feel free to try them out in the console).

3 == (2 + 1)
"intermediate" != "r"
TRUE != FALSE
"Rchitect" != "rchitect"

Notice from the last expression that R is case sensitive: "R" is not equal to "r". Keep this in mind when solving the exercises in this chapter!
